# Orbiting---A Space and Planet Viewing Environment

## Description
This program allows users to tinker with their own uniquely designed planet which is viewed from the persepctive of an orbiting small craft. The program uses an OpenGL API written in C++, with numerous vertex and fragment shaders built in on top to provide the output, among other features such as an edge detection filter and soft blur. 

### More info
The C++ api code is not available here as it's not my own personal work, but all fragment and vertex shaders are available. Alongside this, the .glib file is available, for use in glMan, a program written by Mike Bailey of Oregon State University, accesible here : https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/glman/ .
